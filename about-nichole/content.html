		<p class="greeting">Hello, ðŸ‘‹</p>

		<p>Here's a bit about me. First, Iâ€™m a mom blessed with three beautiful healthy kids and theyâ€™re my world and my main reason for wanting to be healthy. Iâ€™m happily married to my high school sweetheart (which you donâ€™t see a lot of nowadays), and weâ€™ll celebrate our 15th anniversary this July. We are native Michiganders and have been living in the Detroit metro area for about <nobr>five years.</nobr></p>

		<p>Seven years ago, my cardiologist told me that I needed to add exercise into my daily life and make healthy eating a priority. I did it that day. My workouts are now a big part of my life and nutrition has become my passion. I love that itâ€™s always improving, with doctors and scientists learning something new almost every day. I became a nutritionist and a specialist in sports nutrition to help people understand how to eat healthy without being miserable &#8212; there's a way that you can <nobr>still indulge!</nobr></p>

		<p>Iâ€™m here to help you find what works for you. Itâ€™s not just about losing a ton of weight in a short amount of time. Itâ€™s about finding the right portions of the right mix of foods, and indulging in moderation. Itâ€™s all about <i>Embracing <nobr>Your Balance</i>. ðŸ˜‰</nobr></p>

		<p>
			Yours,<br>
