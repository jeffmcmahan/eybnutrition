		<p>I will be helping you decide the best nutrition plan for you, based on what you like and dislike, and based on your weight and fitness goals. I will provide meal ideas and will answer any questions you have about what you should be eating, and how much you should be eating.</p>

		<h2><i class="las la-plus-circle"></i>2 &times; Maintenance Session Fellow-Ups</h2>
		<p>After the first and last scheduled maintenance sessions, I will send an email follow-up within 2&ndash;3 business to outline what we discussed at our session.</p>
