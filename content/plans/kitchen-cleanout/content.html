		<h2><i class="las la-plus-circle"></i>Balance your food options.</h2>
		
		<p>I come to your place to remove anything that tempts you into making poor choices. I won't get rid of every single treat, but we'll make sure your options at home are balanced, and I will offer positive alternatives to whatever foods we&#8217;re getting rid of. I&#8217;ll donate any food that I can to a local food bank.</p>
